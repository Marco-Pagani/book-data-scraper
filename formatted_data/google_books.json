		"description": "This book is about the Arduino microcontroller and the Arduino concept. The visionary Arduino team of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis launched a new innovation in microcontroller hardware in 2005, the concept of open source hardware. Their approach was to openly share details of microcontroller-based hardware design platforms to stimulate the sharing of ideas and promote innovation. This concept has been popular in the software world for many years. This book is intended for a wide variety of audiences including students of the fine arts, middle and senior high school students, engineering design students, and practicing scientists and engineers. To meet this wide audience, the book has been divided into sections to satisfy the need of each reader. The book contains many software and hardware examples to assist the reader in developing a wide variety of systems. The book covers two different Arduino products: the Arduino UNO R3 equipped with the Atmel ATmega328 and the Arduino Mega 2560 equipped with the Atmel ATmega2560. The third edition has been updated with the latest on these two processing boards, changes to the Arduino Development Environment and multiple extended examples.",

		"description": "Learn how to use a Raspberry Pi in conjunction with an Arduino to build a basic robot with advanced capabilities. Getting started in robotics does not have to be difficult. This book is an insightful and rewarding introduction to robotics and a catalyst for further directed study. You'll be led step by step through the process of building a robot that uses the power of a Linux based computer paired with the simplicity of Arduino. You’ll learn why the Raspberry Pi is a great choice for a robotics platform; its strengths as well as its shortcomings; how to overcome these limitations by implementing an Arduino; and the basics of the Python programming language as well as some of the more powerful features. With the Raspberry Pi you can give your project the power of a Linux computer, while Arduino makes interacting with sensors and motors very easy. These two boards are complimentary in their functions; where one falters the other performs admirably. The book also includes references to other great works to help further your growth in the exciting, and now accessible, field of smart robotics. As a bonus, the final chapter of the book demonstrates the real power of the Raspberry Pi by implementing a basic vision system. Using OpenCV and a standard USB web cam, you will build a robot that can chase a ball. What You'll Learn Install Raspbian, the operating system that drives the Raspberry Pi Drive motors through an I2C motor controller Read data through sensors attached to an Arduino Who This Book Is For Hobbyists and students looking for a rapid start in robotics. It assumes no technical background. Readers are guided to pursue the areas that interest them in more detail as they learn.",

Using all of the controls modern color correction software provides, colorists refine the mood, create style, add polish to scenes, and breathe life into the visuals. The craft of color correction can take considerable trial and error to learn, while the art of color grading takes years to perfect. Alexis Van Hurkman draws on his wealth of industry experience to provide a thoroughly updated edition of what has become the standard guide to color correction. Using a friendly, clear teaching style and a slew of real-world examples and anecdotes, Alexis demonstrates how to achieve professional results for any project, using any number of dedicated grading applications, or even an editing program's built-in color correction tools. From the most basic methods for evaluating and correcting an overall image to the most advanced targeted corrections and creative stylizations, Color Correction Handbook, Second Edition, is your one-stop guide. Among many valuable concepts and techniques, you'll learn to: * Set up a professional color correction environment using the latest technologies and adhere to the most up-to-date standards * Work with log-encoded media and LUTs * Analyze shots quickly and correct errors of color and exposure * Create idealized adjustments for key features such as skin tone, skies, and product shots * Develop strategies for balancing clips in a scene to match one another for continuity, and grading greenscreen clips destined for visual effects * Master a variety of stylistic techniques used to set a scene's mood * Apply principles of color and contrast to add depth and visual interest * Browse valuable research about memory colors, audience preferences, and critical corrections for achieving appealing skin tones and controlled environments * Follow along with the downloadable files that accompany this book, including HD footage, cross-platform exercises, and project files.",

Covering everything from conceptualization and planning to post-processing, this book features innovative cookbook-style \"recipes\" for each composite nightscape and time-lapse project. Beginning with a review of the key fundamentals of astronomy and photography, author Mike Shaw covers the latest methods for planning your night shooting sessions and how to set up your gear to get the best constituent images. The book precisely details how to combine images into 12 different varieties of state-of-the-art nightscape trophies, each impossible to capture in a single image, before demonstrating how to create stunning level and ramp time-lapses that transition fluidly from day to night. Each nightscape and time-lapse project category includes specific tips for (i) acquiring the constituent images; (ii) assembling them into the composite image or time-lapse; (iii) overcoming common obstacles and (iv) finding the best subjects. Providing examples of how to apply these techniques in the field through four detailed case studies, including one, three-night immersive retreat, this book is the comprehensive guide to creating creative nightscapes and time-lapses.",

		"description": "Design thinking is a powerful process that facilitates understanding and framing of problems, enables creative solutions, and may provide fresh perspectives on our physical and social landscapes. Not just for architects or product developers, design thinking can be applied across many disciplines to solve real-world problems and reconcile dilemmas. It is a tool that may trigger inspiration and the imagination, and lead to innovative ideas that are responsive to the needs and issues of stakeholders. Design Thinking: A Guide to Creative Problem Solving for Everyone will assist in addressing a full spectrum of challenges from the most vexing to the everyday. It renders accessible the creative problem-solving abilities that we all possess by providing a dynamic framework and practical tools for thinking imaginatively and critically. Every aspect of design thinking is explained and analyzed together with insights on navigating through the process. Application of design thinking to help solve myriad problems that are not typically associated with design is illuminated through vignettes drawn from such diverse realms as politics and society, business, health and science, law, and writing. A combination of theory and application makes this volume immediately useful and personally relevant.",

		"description": "As a \"third space\" on campus, the library is poised to be the location where researchers and students will come for help with creative endeavors, such as multimedia projects, data visualization, 3D printing and more. Libraries worldwide are coming up with innovative ways to engage students in this dialog, including by setting aside high-tech spaces for creativity. Five models of library creative spaces are explored in this book: digital media labs, Digital Humanities labs, makerspaces, data visualization labs, and knowledge markets. Digital media labs can assist students with audio and video projects for multimodal assignments and their own artistic work. Digital Humanities labs assist faculty and students to envision new scholarship on historical and artistic topics, with librarians and technical staff to instruct and guide them. Makerspaces are problem solving spaces that allow people to tinker, invent, or create 3D models. A visualization lab is a high-tech space used for simulations and data analysis, and may include a visualization wall or other interactive components. A knowledge market is a collaboration between the library (research help), the speech center (presentation skills), the writing center (writing and citation help), along with a data visualization and/or multimedia instruction component. This book explores creative spaces being offered currently in libraries, with a focus on academic libraries. It goes on to give real-world advice for the process of crafting a new space in the library, including finding campus partners, conducting a needs analysis, and answering important questions. Case studies of innovators of library creativity will further highlight the successes-and pitfalls-of embarking on the process of developing a new service or space in the library.",

		"description": "Data will not help you if you can't see it where you need it. Or can't collect it where you need it. Upon these principles, wearable technology was born. And although smart watches and fitness trackers have become almost ubiquitous, with in-body sensors on the horizon, the future applications of wearable computers hold so much more. A trusted reference for almost 15 years, Fundamentals of Wearable Computers and Augmented Reality goes beyond smart clothing to explore user interface design issues specific to wearable tech and areas in which it can be applied. Upon its initial publication, the first edition almost instantly became a trusted reference, setting the stage for the coming decade, in which the explosion in research and applications of wearable computers and augmented reality occurred. Written by expert researchers and teachers, each chapter in the second edition has been revised and updated to reflect advances in the field and provide fundamental knowledge on each topic, solidifying the book's reputation as a valuable technical resource as well as a textbook for augmented reality and ubiquitous computing courses. New Chapters in the Second Edition Explore: Haptics Visual displays Use of augmented reality for surgery and manufacturing Technical issues of image registration and tracking Augmenting the environment with wearable audio interfaces Use of augmented reality in preserving cultural heritage Human-computer interaction and augmented reality technology Spatialized sound and augmented reality Augmented reality and robotics Computational clothing From a technology perspective, much of what is happening now with wearables and augmented reality would not have been possible even five years ago. In the fourteen years since the first edition burst on the scene, the capabilities and applications of both technologies are orders of magnitude faster, smaller, and cheaper. Yet the book's overarching mission remains the same: to supply the fundamental information and basic knowledge about the design and use of wearable computers and augmented reality with the goal of enhancing people's lives.",

		"description": "Although most people have heard of laser-cut and 3-D printed model railway parts and kits, most modellers have little knowledge or experience of them. This fascinating and well-illustrated book describes in non-technical language how these machines work and how railway modellers can use them to produce remarkable models for their layouts. With reference to the different modelling scales, the author discusses in detail the advantages and disadvantages of different types of machines, and the materials they employ. He also shows how beginners can install and use 'Sketchup Make', a free CAD (Computer Aided Design) program from the Internet. With step-by-step instructions and accompanying photographs, the author takes the modeller through the early stages of using this program before providing many examples of how to design model railway related items such as laser-cut roofing tiles, palisade fencing, brickwork, and the detailed elements of station awning. In addition, he demonstrates how to create 3-D printed furniture, barrels, packing crates, guttering and down pipes, rivet heads, and a workman's hut.The CAD skills learnt whilst following the clear instructions on how to draw these examples will enable modellers to design their own model railway parts, which can either be produced on their own machines or be sent away to be created by one of the many 'bureau' companies. Clear step-by-step instructions are given along with over 430 superb colour images.",

Written by the expert team from the Agency by Design initiative at Harvard's Project Zero, this book Identifies a set of educational practices and ideas that define maker-centered learning, and introduces the focal concepts of maker empowerment and sensitivity to design. Shares cutting edge research that provides evidence of the benefits of maker-centered learning for students and education as a whole. Presents a clear Project Zero-based framework for maker-centered teaching and learning Includes valuable educator resources that can be applied in a variety of design and maker-centered learning environments Describes unique thinking routines that foster the primary maker capacities of looking closely, exploring complexity, and finding opportunity. A surge of voices from government, industry, and education have argued that, in order to equip the next generation for life and work in the decades ahead, it is vital to support maker-centered learning in various educational environments. Maker-Centered Learning provides insight into what that means, and offers tools and knowledge that can be applied anywhere that learning takes place.",

		"description": "Spaces that have been designed to allow users to create, build, and learn new projects and technologies, makerspaces employ a variety of tools such as 3-D printers, AutoCAD design software, and even open-source hardware like Arduino Kits. Developing a community around shared use of space and equipment, a tenet of the makerspace movement, fits squarely into libraries’ mission. Bagley examines nine makerspaces in public, academic, and school libraries, describing their design and technical decisions in depth and showing how each is doing something unique and different, under a wide range of budgets and project offerings. Enabling readers to quickly gather information about these trailblazing projects, Bagley’s guide Defines the makerspace, and describes why it fits perfectly into the library’s role as community center Answers common questions about implementing a makerspace project, detailing how libraries are addressing issues such as registration, usage policy, noise, software programs in digital workspaces, adapting spaces, funding, and promotion Illustrates approaches libraries are taking to staffing makerspaces, from Anchorage Public Library’s Maker in Residence and Mesa Public Library's THINKspot coordinator, to the library school students involved with University of Michigan and University of Illinois makerspace projects Covers the demographics of makerspace users, from children and teens to hobbyists and job seekers, offering guidance for targeting, marketing, and programming A sourcebook of ideas that readers can apply at their own institutions, this resource also demonstrates how makerspaces can be gathering places for people to learn how to create and build together as a community.",

		"description": "Leverage your Arduino skills in the Raspberry Pi world and see how to cross the two platforms into sophisticated programs. The Arduino and Raspberry Pi communities overlap more than you might think. Arduinos can be expanded to have network capabilities with a variety of “shields,” all of which increase the cost and complexity of the system. By contrast, Raspberry Pis all run Linux, which is a very network-competent platform. The newest Pi, the Raspberry Pi Zero W, is WiFi and Bluetooth capable, and costs around $10 U.S. For network enabled gadgets, it makes far more sense to cross to the Raspberry PI platform, if only someone would make it easy to do. That's what this book is about. You'll learn some survival level Linux system administration, so you know how to set the machine up and how to establish at least minimal security for your gadget. You''ll set up and learn the Geany IDE on your Pi, which is fairly similar to the Arduino IDE. Where the two platforms overlap the most is the GPIO system. You'll see that several projects use and explain the WiringPi system. This is is deliberately similar to the Arduino's 'Wiring' functionality, which is how sketches interact with GPIO pins. You'll learn the differences between the GPIO pins of the two devices, and how the Pi has some limitations on those pins that the Arduino does not. As a final project, in an effort to escape some of those limitations, you'll attach an AtMEGA 328P to the Raspberry Pi and configure it as a real, 8MHz Arduino with the Arduino IDE running on the Pi, and learn how to have the two platforms communicate, giving you the best of both worlds. What You'll Learn Establish security with Linux system administration Set up the Apache webserver Write CGI programs so other computers can connect to your Pi and pull data in from it. Use C/C++ from Arduino sketches to write programs for the Pi Who This Book Is For The Arduino user who's been through all the tutorials and is comfortable writing sketches and connecting hardware to their Arduino.",

Smart textiles are a key part of this revolution. Smart Textiles for Designers introduces the different qualities and properties that can be embedded in, integrated with, and applied to fabrics, and looks at the different contexts in which these smart textiles can be used. A survey of specific fabrics grouped by properties provides a core reference section and a palette for the designer to work from. The book also examines five different design approaches and features interviews with leading designer and design teams, showing their processes and working methods. The first book to look at smart textiles through the eyes of a designer, this is both a core reference work and an inspirational guide for students and professionals alike.",

		"description": "The Art, Science, and Craft of Great Landscape Photography teaches photographers how to convert their visual peak experiences-moments of extraordinary natural beauty that evoke a sense of wonder and awe-into stunning images that elicit the same awestruck emotion in their viewers. Randall is an experienced wilderness photographer, and whether you want to venture into the mountains for once-in-a-lifetime shots of raw nature, or simply hone your landscape photography skills from the safety of your back deck, Randall explains the art, science and craft of creating astounding images.Randall begins by focusing on the art of landscape photography. He describes his three-step process for composing a photograph and shows how good composition is an organic process that begins with rules but ultimately transcends them. Randall then explores the science behind successful landscape photographs, which requires understanding key concepts from geography, optics, vision, and psychology. These concepts include: Understanding how the position of the sun at sunrise and sunset varies throughout the year, which will help you plan when and where to shoot. Understanding optics to predict where rainbows will appear, how polarizers will interact with reflections, and where to find spectacular light. Understanding how to use topographic maps and computerized mapping tools to help you find the most promising shooting locations in the wilderness. Understanding how our visual system analyzes images and the psychology of how we view art. These insights will help you produce successful photographs. Exposure is a central aspect of the craft of landscape photography, and Randall tackles the challenges of this topic from every angle-from tips on calculating exposures in the field, to achieving correct exposure in high-contrast lighting situations, to the best digital darkroom techniques.Great landscape photography can be mastered with practice and by applying the techniques taught in this book. The Art, Science, and Craft of Great Landscape Photography is intended for those who already understand the basics of photography and who are ready to master the finer nuances of creating magnificent landscape photographs.

This is your ultimate, must-have, tip-packed guide for taking your DIY projects to the next level—from basic wood and metalworking skills to plugged-in fun with power tools, and from cutting-edge electronics play to 3-D printing wizardry. Join Chris Hackett, intrepid DIY-er, on a rummage through the toolbox of yore—and a foray into the technologies of the future. Packed with demystifying explanations and helpful tips, The Big Book of Maker Skills covers: HAND TOOLS A classic is a classic for a reason. Learn to build your own metal forge, screen-print whatever you want, swing a hammer better than your ancestors, and repurpose what Hackett calls “obtanium”—but what others might call trash—into your own mad-scientist creations. POWER TOOLS Discover the supreme joy that is angle-grinding, rig your own welding machine out of a junked car battery or three, and meet and master a whole host of electronic gadgets—LEDs, piezo buzzers, solar panels, and more. ROBOTS & BEYOND When it comes to making, there’s a whole new skillset in town. Get started with CNC milling, laser-cutting, programming microcontrollers, and 3D printing in a chapter that’s all about building what’s next. MUCH MORE Setting up a hackerspace, drones and space exploration tools, circuitry basics, sourcing and crowdsourcing and biotechnology-just to name a few more.

The Weaving Explorer removes that barrier, inviting crafters and artists to try out an amazing range of techniques and creative projects that are achievable with a simple homemade loom, or no loom at all! Weavers Deborah Jarchow and Gwen W. Steege take inspiration from the world of folk weaving traditions, adding a contemporary spin by introducing an unexpected range of materials and home dec projects. From sturdy rag fabric grocery bags to freeform wire baskets, delicately woven thread bracelets to colorful woven rugs, crafters will delight in exploring the opportunities to make their own personal variations on these beautiful — and functional — creations.",
