With a long history and an enthusiastic community of users, it is the ideal choice for almost any kind of work with 3D modeling or animation. However, for new users, its power and flexibillity can sometimes be daunting, and that’s when you need this book! The book starts by showing you round the all-new Blender 2.8 user interface. You'll look at the most commonly-used options and tools, such as navigating in 3D and selecting objects. You will then use and manipulate one of the most important windows of the interface, the 3D View. You'll learn how to use essential tools for working with 3D modeling. To give your models the feel of real-world objects, you'll learn how to create materials and set up surfaces. You'll see how to use Physically-Based Rendering (PBR), which allows you to craft realistic surfaces such as wood, stone, and metal. You will also work with Eevee, a new real-time render engine in Blender. You will see how to add motion to objects, making use of Blender's impressive 3D animation features. Finally, you'll learn how to create scenes and organize them for rendering, and later add titles and effects using built-in Blender tools. By the end of the book, you will be able to use Blender 2.8 new UI, Create 3D Models with textures, Animations, and Render them in real-time using Eevee. What you will learn Manipulate and visualize your 3D objects in Blender Use polygon modeling tools such as extrude, loop cut, and more Apply precision modeling tools like snapping and the 3D Cursor Render a scene using the real-time engine Eevee Create materials for Eevee and Cycles Render a scene with the Eevee real-time engine Use PBR textures to craft realistic surfaces such as wood with the Shader Editor Add motion and animation using keyframes Create animation loops using curves and modifiers Who this book is for This book is for anyone interested in taking their steps with Blender. If you're an experienced 3D artists or hobbyist, this book will help you with its features.",

Not just for architects or product developers, design thinking can be applied across many disciplines to solve real-world problems and reconcile dilemmas. It is a tool that may trigger inspiration and the imagination, and lead to innovative ideas that are responsive to the needs and issues of stakeholders. Design Thinking: A Guide to Creative Problem Solving for Everyone will assist in addressing a full spectrum of challenges from the most vexing to the everyday. It renders accessible the creative problem-solving abilities that we all possess by providing a dynamic framework and practical tools for thinking imaginatively and critically. Every aspect of design thinking is explained and analyzed together with insights on navigating through the process. Application of design thinking to help solve myriad problems that are not typically associated with design is illuminated through vignettes drawn from such diverse realms as politics and society, business, health and science, law, and writing. A combination of theory and application makes this volume immediately useful and personally relevant.",

        "description": "As a \"third space\" on campus, the library is poised to be the location where researchers and students will come for help with creative endeavors, such as multimedia projects, data visualization, 3D printing and more. Libraries worldwide are coming up with innovative ways to engage students in this dialog, including by setting aside high-tech spaces for creativity. Five models of library creative spaces are explored in this book: digital media labs, Digital Humanities labs, makerspaces, data visualization labs, and knowledge markets. Digital media labs can assist students with audio and video projects for multimodal assignments and their own artistic work. Digital Humanities labs assist faculty and students to envision new scholarship on historical and artistic topics, with librarians and technical staff to instruct and guide them. Makerspaces are problem solving spaces that allow people to tinker, invent, or create 3D models. A visualization lab is a high-tech space used for simulations and data analysis, and may include a visualization wall or other interactive components. A knowledge market is a collaboration between the library (research help), the speech center (presentation skills), the writing center (writing and citation help), along with a data visualization and/or multimedia instruction component. This book explores creative spaces being offered currently in libraries, with a focus on academic libraries. It goes on to give real-world advice for the process of crafting a new space in the library, including finding campus partners, conducting a needs analysis, and answering important questions. Case studies of innovators of library creativity will further highlight the successes-and pitfalls-of embarking on the process of developing a new service or space in the library.",

This fascinating and well-illustrated book describes in non-technical language how these machines work and how railway modellers can use them to produce remarkable models for their layouts. With reference to the different modelling scales, the author discusses in detail the advantages and disadvantages of different types of machines, and the materials they employ. He also shows how beginners can install and use 'Sketchup Make', a free CAD (Computer Aided Design) program from the Internet. With step-by-step instructions and accompanying photographs, the author takes the modeller through the early stages of using this program before providing many examples of how to design model railway related items such as laser-cut roofing tiles, palisade fencing, brickwork, and the detailed elements of station awning. In addition, he demonstrates how to create 3-D printed furniture, barrels, packing crates, guttering and down pipes, rivet heads, and a workman's hut.The CAD skills learnt whilst following the clear instructions on how to draw these examples will enable modellers to design their own model railway parts, which can either be produced on their own machines or be sent away to be created by one of the many 'bureau' companies. Clear step-by-step instructions are given along with over 430 superb colour images.",

The Weaving Explorer removes that barrier, inviting crafters and artists to try out an amazing range of techniques and creative projects that are achievable with a simple homemade loom, or no loom at all! Weavers Deborah Jarchow and Gwen W. Steege take inspiration from the world of folk weaving traditions, adding a contemporary spin by introducing an unexpected range of materials and home dec projects. From sturdy rag fabric grocery bags to freeform wire baskets, delicately woven thread bracelets to colorful woven rugs, crafters will delight in exploring the opportunities to make their own personal variations on these beautiful — and functional — creations.",
