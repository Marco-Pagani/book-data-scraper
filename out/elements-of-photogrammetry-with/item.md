The definitive guide to photogrammetry--fully updated Thoroughly revised to cover the latest technological advances in the field, Elements of Photogrammetry with Applications in GIS, Fourth Edition, provides complete details on the foundational principles of photogrammetry as well as important advanced concepts. Significant changes in the instruments and procedures used in modern photogrammetry, including laser scanning, are discussed. Example problems clarify computational procedures and extensive photographs and diagrams illustrate the material presented in this comprehensive resource. Coverage includes: Principles of photography and imaging Cameras and other imaging devices Image measurements and refinements Object space coordinate systems Vertical photographs Stereoscopic viewing Stereoscopic parallax Stereoscopic plotting instruments Laser scanning systems Elementary methods of planimetric mapping for GIS Titled and oblique photographs Introduction to analytical photogrammetry Topographic mapping and spatial data collection Fundamental principles of digital image processing Photogrammetric applications in GIS Control for aerial photogrammetry Aerotriangulation Project planning Terrestrial and close-range photogrammetry
