This book will show you inspirational ways in which paper can be used to create textured and relief surfaces. These techniques are mostly intuitive and easy to make, requiring no origami or paper engineering knowledge. There are 12 different techniques: Twisting narrow strips to make "paper string," Weaving strips, Layering, Coiling, Tearing, Bending, Incising and Lifting, Crumpling, Pleating, Cutting Pleats, Stippling, and using Translucent Surfaces. Each is beautifully illustrated with creative examples, first made in white paper and then in papers of different colors, weights, and textures. Finally, inspirational photographs show the techniques applied by designers to clothing, furniture, jewelry, and homewares, as well as artworks. These techniques could be used by professional designers, design students in disciplines from textiles to interior design, and anyone with an interest in paper craft.
