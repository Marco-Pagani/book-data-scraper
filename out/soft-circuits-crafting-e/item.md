Soft Circuits introduces students to the world of wearable technology. Using Modkit, an accessible DIY electronics toolkit, students learn to create e-textile cuffs, �electrici-tee� shirts, and solar-powered backpacks. Students also learn the importance of one component to the whole?how, for example, changing the structure of LED connections immediately affects the number of LEDs that light up.
