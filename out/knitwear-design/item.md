Packed with diagrams, knitwear samples and images from a wide range of contemporary designers, the book offers a practical approach to designing garments from initial research, finding sources of inspiration and developing the design, through an exploration of color, texture, and knitting techniques to constructing a garment and creating and writing a pattern. Knitwear Design also showcases the techniques that are transforming knitted textiles, such as heat treatments and painting and printing knit, and profiles the fusing of knitting, art, and craft.
