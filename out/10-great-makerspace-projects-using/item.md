Technology and tools once available only in factories can now be found in classroom makerspaces. Maker culture uses 3D printers, laser cutters, and other manufacturing tools to provide invaluable learning experiences. Combining technology with more abstract ideas such as social justice, history, and civics can lead students to become more involved with the local community as well the global one. This interesting guide provides step-by-step instructions to help both educators and students experience social studies projects like never before. Learn how to implement STEM principles to make social studies hands-on and fun at the same time.
